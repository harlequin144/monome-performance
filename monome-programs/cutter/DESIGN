This program will serve as my 'cutter' samlper, primarily giving me the ability
to cut or subloop samples. Here are a few features

- Sub looping: pressing a button on a row will start playing the sample at that
	point. After holding that initial press, another press will set the point at
	which that sample will loop back to the start point.

- Button press quantization: for the buttons that are on the channels rows,
	presses will be quantized in sync with the tempo

- Mute groups: On the top row of buttons (called the control row), pressing a
	button will trigger a mute of all channels that are assigned to that group and
	stop their playing. I need to decide how this will be controlled...


Features that definitely need to be implemented later
- Pattern recording: Press one of the pattern recorders and then press a bunch
	of buttons and the recorder will make that sequence happen over and over again
	in time....


Features that may be implemented:
- reversing the loop on the fly
- changing play back speed on the fly
- stretching the loop to be in sync with the tempo.????
