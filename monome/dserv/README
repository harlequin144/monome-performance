Dserver Documentation

The dserver does a couple of things. It is will keep track of the drum
sample buffers. It will load a default set of samples when it is
constructed and will be used to manage changing those samples. Also, it
will set up osc responders that will allow for triggering those sample with
osc messages from other programs. For now, fast triggering will not make
sample playback overlap. 

Other programs will interact with dserver as follows: programs can send an osc
message to supercollider with the following path
	/sc/dserver/trigger num
num will represent the sample to be triggered. For convention, samples will be
numbered as follows:

0 	1st snare
1		2nd snare
2		1st kick
3		2nd kick
4		closed hh
5		open hh
6		other symbol (shaker)
7		ride
8		aux
9		
10
11


The server is intended for drum samples only because it is ideal for them.
It can be used to trigger general samples however.
