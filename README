This directory, ~/code/music, is intended to be used as a place to develope
code for making programs that are used to compose, or perform music. It shall
not contain code that is itself music, or files that are meant to be run in
order to set up or do something specifically for a performance. I.e. it does
not contain compositions or scripts that use the tools that are developed in
this directory.  For example, this directory will contain the supercollider
code for the transport that I commonly use with my other monome programs. This
is a tool that I use to perform music. However, if I have another
supercollider program that is effectively meant to be run so as to generate a
song or a recording of a song, this would be considered a composition and will
be stored elsewhere. 

This directory is rather remotely located from where the bulk of my other
music files are (~/music). This is because, the development of the tools I use
to make music and the files that make use of those tools (or don't for that
matter) need to be separated. This directory should not need to be known to
any files that are located in ~/music. This will keep the division between use
and development clean.

It is true that the scripts that might make use of these programs can be said
to be under development. I will make an exception for these, as it is intended
that this development will be quick and simple. 

The question of where is the appropriate place to store composition-programs
remains. This will be settled later.
