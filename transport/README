The transport works by sending out 48 tick messages for every beat. The
messages have a number from 0 thru 47. The down beat will start at 0. To
avoid the necessity to know where the beat is when there is no sound that is
aligned with it, the down beat can be shifted to something other than 0. The
down beat is shifted to the last tick only when the transport is rolling and a
new first tap is recieved. There is no need to move it back or anything. When
the down beat is shifted, the transport must broadcast which tick will now be
the down beat. 

This way is good because it provides flexibility. Programs that are more
rigidly watching the beat can still rely on it as long as they are capable of
responding to the change. Programs that are less tied to the beat can ignore
it and just use the speed of ticks to trigger things. 

Examples: The sequencer on the Micronome will still play its notes in time
and starting with the down beat. If the user starts using the transport to say
trigger some hi hats that are in time but started on an arbitrary beat, as
long as the user realigns the down beat properly, the sequence will still play
in time.
