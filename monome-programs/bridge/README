# This is another attemp at making the bridge. The bridge will do the following
# things:
#
#-route osc traffic to child programs
#-provide a monome interface to switch to those child programs
#-provide a mixer interface on the monome to send master level adjustments to
# child programs
#-provide a monome interface to send tap tempo things messages to sc
#-provide a place to see what the current tempo setting is

#
# Will it try to continue to make sure other programs are running?
#


To Do
- finish implementing tempo control
- create the console interface
