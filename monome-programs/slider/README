This program is a very simple and general slider program specifically meant
to be controlled via the monome. It will be used to send control data via OSC
only to any source. Here is a list of design parameters:

-Signals sent to other programs via OSC only
-All signals are floats between 0 and 1
-Each slider channel can be assigned to an OSC port



MONOME INTERFACE

The left most 15 columns function as sliders. Pressing any point on a column
will change the value to the button pressed. The right most will be a master
slider that can change all of the slider values together. The right column
(control column) will also be the place where exiting will be done. When two
buttons on the control column are pressed, slider will hide and exit to the
bridge. Note that the first press of an exit press must still change the
value of the master slider. For the other columns pressing two buttons at
once will change the program to fine grain control. In this mode pressing any
button will change the fine grain level of the slider, and then releasing
that button will exit fine grain mode back to regular.

Here is a summary

  -pressing any one button shall change the silder value.
  -pressing and holding two buttons on the right most column shall trigger a
   hide and exit to the bridge. 
  -pressing and holding two buttons on other columns opens up a fine grain
   control page. Pressing changes, then releasing exits back to regular
   program.


COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

  The command line command for slider will accept the following options:
  -p select the listening port
 
  We will have the following other arguments
  -Path to a file to read with commands
 
  Standard Input Commands
  -Change listening port
  -Change send port for channel
  -Hide/quit

To Do
 -Implement command line reading
 	-quitting
 	-hidding
 	-destination port changing (channelnum > portnum)
 	-ability to change range values??

 -let listening port be given as a command line argument so that multipule
 	instances can run at the same time.
